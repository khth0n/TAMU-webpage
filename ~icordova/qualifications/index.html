                The 12th Unmanned Team is an organization run by passionate students
                and faculty alike, with participants of varying academic backgrounds and
                experience who are working to achieve a safe, reliable, and robust autonomous
                driving system for SAE International's Autodrive Challenge.
                I joined the project as a volunteer during my junior year of attending
                Texas A&M University out of personal interest in the subject and challenge
                of autonomous driving, as well as personal curiousity over the computer control
                systems used on modern automobiles.
                My current responsibilities involve integrating and
                optimizing the project's established code base to leverage GPU acceleration using Data Parallel C++.
                Additionally, I have been learning about leveraging LiDAR sensor feedback and video-based image
                processing for computer vision tasks related to object detection, recognition, and tracking.

            <h1>FIRST Robotics FTC</h1>
            <p>
                I participated in the FIRST Robotics FIRST Tech Challenge competitions
                from 2017-2019, participating in Relic Recovery and Rover Ruckus
                for my high school's team, #11918 - Grizzly Bots.

                With many of the founding members of the club leaving
                the program after 2016, I joined the program to
                help keep it alive despite my lackluster
                understanding of computers at the time.

                With a limited budget and small group of remaining upperclassmen,
                I took up the lone role of learning how to write software for the
                robot to run and give our team the best possible results at
                competitions. 

                At the time, I had little to no programming experience,
                so I consider this club as my first experience with
                programming in any capacity, and also my first
                experience learning how software could interface
                with hardware to perform various tasks in the real world.
                    
                In retrospect, I find that this club to be an endearing and
                foundational experience in encouraging and motivating me to
                learn more about computers in general, even if the results
                I received were holistically disappointing at the time.

            <p>
                I was selected to represent my district at the annual
                State Conference as a House Representative for the
                2018-2019 and 2019-2020 program years.
                    
                I would consider my two finest achievements
                within the program to be the two public policy
                bills I created and defended regarding the restriction
                of social media terms of service for minors and
                consumer data privacy. Although not credited as
                my bills directly, Texas HB4 and HB18 from the
                88th Texas State Legislative Session are
                eerily similar bills to the two that I
                presented many years before it. For better or
                worse, both bills passed both
                chambers of Congress and were signed
                into law by Governor Abbott, vindicating
                my predictions about public policy within
                the state of Texas. 

                Overall, this program was instrumental in building my
                public speaking, technical writing, argumentation, debate,
                and etiquette skills as well as providing me a deeper
                understanding of the American legislative process.
