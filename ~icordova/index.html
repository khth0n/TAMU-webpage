    <p>My journey through software development</p>
    <p>
        Joined a club in middle school called CyberPatriots which taught me about Operating Systems
        and basic computer security
    </p>
    <p>
        In high school, around 10th grade, I had the opportunity to take courses
        such as PLTW's Digital Electronics and some basic computer science courses
    </p>
    <p>
        My first personal projects as a novice programmer included java swing
        applications of Snake, Tetris, and Sudoku Solver
    </p>
    <p>
        I joined my school's robotics club and participated in a number of
        district and regional competitions as the only programmer on my
        team.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the remainder of my high school experience, I continued to pick up
        programming knowledge and developed a couple of random
        projects; some completed and others currently incomplete
        until I had the chance to work on them at a later time. I also
        became familiar with concepts related to computer network
        architecture  
    </p>
    <p>
        I applied to the Texas A&M College of Engineering and eventually
        took up the Computer Engineering major with an emphasis in 
        Computer Science
    </p>
    <p>
        In my junior year of College, I participated in the Autodrive Project
        at my campus as a programmer working to optimize vision and tracking
        tasks with a combination of image processing and GPU programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently looking for any internship opportunities,
        particularly if they involve software development, networking,
        or AI/ML.
    </p>
