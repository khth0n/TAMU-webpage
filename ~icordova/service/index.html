        <h2>Holiday Event Volunteering for City Events</h2>
        <h3>
            During high school, I volunteered for
            Leander's Trunk-or-Treat and Round Rock's
            Christmas Dreams & Snowy Things events
            regularly.
        </h3>
        <h1>Volunteering for School-related Functions</h1>
        <h2>
            Also during high school, I volunteered for
            a number of events as a representative of
            my school. I often would act as a greeter
            and cleaner for my high school's theatre
            performances, help organize and contribute
            to the annual club parades, and assist the
            administration as an office aide during
            free periods. As a member of the National
            Honor Society, I also participated in
            most of the service projects my chapter
            participated in.

        <h1>Future Service Projects</h1>
        <h2>Fundraising and Volunteering in Local Robotics Programs</h2>
        <h3>
            Having experienced what it was like to participate in a
            robotics program with little funding, I know how
            discouraging it can be to even the most passionate
            communities. 
            Similarly, I would like to volunteering to teach
            participants about developing software for
            robots in a beginner-friendly yet equally
            foundationally
