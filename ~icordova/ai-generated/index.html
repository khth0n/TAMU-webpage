            This page was a foray into the potential of AI/ML and the ways it can be used by developers
            productively. Had I implemented either the Random Name Generator or Story Generator by hand,
            it would have taken much longer than simply using generative AI prompts to populate their
            respective datasets to get a decently reasonable output. From what I have examined,
            prompt engineering seems most reliable when you first ask about the objective or
            problem you want to solve and then ask it to implement one of the ideas it references.
            Using this system, and a continual question-response back-and-forth you can simulate
            iteration by adding little features, additions, or changes you want to be conducted on
            the code it previously generated. This has potential to dramatically reduce development time
            or help in testing, particularly if there is a component that can leverage generative AI responses
            such as a generic list of names or similar dummy data that ChatGPT might be able to reasonably
            generate. Note that problems or projects that are more simple or common are significantly easier
            to get in a single-shot as compared to more complex or uncommon problems, as demonstrated by
            the Perlin Noise prompt compared to the two generator prompts.

        <h1>Prompt List</h1>
    
        <h2>Random Name Generator</h2>
        <p>
            1. what are some random name generation algorithms?
            2. are you able to produce an random name generation algorithm in javascript?
            3. can you create a random name generator that uses markov chains in typescript, preferably with a preloaded dataset of names
            4. can you implement this without an npm package? (it attempted to include one, so I asked it to remove it)
            5. can you now make a gui to generate random names using this algorithm with HTML and css?
            6. can you now fill the dataset with 2000 names of cities from fantasy novels? (hilariously it gave up about 100 names in)
            7. (I asked it slowly to add more names and some from different genres and specified unique since it began to add duplicates without it)
            8. can you now remove repeated names from the dataset and add more unique ones?
        </p>
    
        <h2>Perlin Noise</h2>
        <p>
            1. do you know how to implement perlin noise in typescript (it responded with a 1D perlin noise algorithm)
            2. can you make 2d perlin noise?
            3. can you generate perlin noise and display it in an html canvas?
            4. can you add sliders for controlling the perlin noise to this design?
        </p>
    
        <h2>Story Generator</h2>
        <p>
            1. what are some ways to procedurally generate a story?
            2. do you know a way to procedurally generate a story with typescript?
            3. do you know how to implement story grammers? (one of the methods provided from question 1)
            4. do you know to procedurally generate plot elements? (another method provided from question 2, seems to have combined with output from question 3)
            5. do you know how to implement template-based stories? (another method provided from question 2, seems to have combined with output from previous)
            6. can you add more unique story templates to this?
            7. can you add more unique characters?
            8. can you add more unique goals?
            9. can you combine all of this into one typescript file?
            10. can you add more replace conditions for every possible story template? (this was the way I gamed it to update the conditions it was not updating)
            11. can you now display these an html paragraph element?
            12. can you add a button to generate the stories?
        </p>
